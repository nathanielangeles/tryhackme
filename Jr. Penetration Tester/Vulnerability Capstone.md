# TryHackMe Vulnerability Capstone

## Overview

This writeup documents the steps taken to complete the TryHackMe Vulnerability Capstone challenge, which involves identifying a vulnerable web application, enumerating its version, researching an exploit, and retrieving a flag from the target machine.

## Target Information

**Target IP**: `10.10.178.91`

## Tools Used

- Web browser (for enumeration via HTTP)
- Google (for CVE identification)
- Public Exploit (Remote Code Execution)

## Enumeration

Upon visiting the site:

```
http://10.10.178.91/
```

We can identify the application name and version from information disclosure in the source code or web interface.

**Application Name**: `FUEL CMS`

**Application Version**: `1.4`

## Vulnerability Research

Using the discovered application version, we searched for known vulnerabilities and found the following CVE:

**CVE for Remote Code Execution**: `CVE-2018-16763`

## Exploitation

We used the following public exploit to gain RCE on the target:

After gaining access, we executed the following command to retrieve the flag:

```bash
cat /home/ubuntu/flag.txt
```

**Flag**: `THM{flag_value_here}`

## Conclusion

This capstone provided hands-on experience in:

- Information gathering via web application reconnaissance
- Vulnerability identification using public CVEs
- Exploiting a known RCE vulnerability in Fuel CMS
- Navigating a target system to retrieve sensitive data

It's a solid exercise in vulnerability assessment and exploitation.
